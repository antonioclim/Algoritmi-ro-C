# XOR Problem Dataset
# Demonstrează că XOR NU este liniar separabil
# Un singur perceptron NU poate învăța această funcție
# Necesar: MLP cu cel puțin un strat ascuns
#
# Tabela de adevăr XOR:
# x1=0, x2=0 → y=0
# x1=0, x2=1 → y=1
# x1=1, x2=0 → y=1
# x1=1, x2=1 → y=0
#
# Date cu zgomot pentru antrenare realistă
